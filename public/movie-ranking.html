<h1>Top Recommended Movies by Clair</h1>
<h2>Recommendations for Each Genre</h2>

<hr />

<h3>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</h3>
<p>They don't make RomComs like this anymore. It's cliche for a reason.</p>

<h3>How to Train Your Dragon 1</h3>
<p>Dragons + S Tier OST</p>

<h3>The Maze Runner</h3>
<p>I just miss dystopian movies in general. They need to bring them back.</p>
